		<h1>Intro to OpenFin Tearouts</h1>
		<p>
			The OpenFin Runtime makes it possible to 'tear out' elements from an application 
			and have them persist in windows on their own.  A newly created tearout window 
			becomes a child of the application it came from.
		</p>
		<h2>Creating a Tearout Window</h2>
		<p>
			When you decide you want to tear out an element for your application, you need to create 
			an OpenFin window to receive the DOM element. This is done with a call to <code>new fin.desktop.Window</code>. 
			Because there is a startup cost to creating a window, often applications will create a pool of 
			pre-created, empty windows and leave them in a hidden state until needed. When asked for a new window, the 
			OpenFin Javascript adapter calls window.open and returns a reference to the 
			parent that is wrapped in an OpenFin Window object. Being an OpenFin window means that 
			the parent is able to make OpenFin API calls against it. For example, the parent window can 
			move, animate, show, hide, minimize, maximize, etc the created child window.
		</p>
		<h2>Dragging a Tearout Window</h2>
		<p>
			The actual dragging out of the element can be initiated in a number of ways. One option (and the one 
			demonstrated here) is to inject the element that is to be dragged out into a waiting destination tearout window 
			on click. From here you can move the new tearout programmatically. Another option is to use native HTML5 drag 
			and drop to determine where the drop location will be and on the drop event place the tearout window. The only 
			caveat to this method is that once the mouse leaves the bounds of the parent window you no longer are able to 
			set <code>event.preventDefault()</code> on a dragover event. Unfortunately, Windows does not show the 'not-
			allowed' cursor even though for our purposes we really can drop anywhere. To mitigate this, you can move an 
			OpenFin window, with opacity set to .01, programmatically to always be behind the mouse. In so doing you are 
			able to have the correct cursor prompt. The OpenChat 
			<span class="browser-link" destination="http://openfin.co/app-gallery.html">(available on OpenFin’s Gallery)</span> application is a good example of how to demonstrate this behavior.

			You can browse the annotated source for the parent window  
			<span class="browser-link" destination="https://demoappdirectory.openf.in/desktop/deploy/tearout-demo/docs/tearout.html">here</span>,
			and the for the drop target

		<h2>Drag Out To Frame</h2>
		<p>
			In this example you can initially drag out the element. After 
			you release the element you can use the navigation bar to move 
			the element. Close the window to return the element to the patent
		</p>
		<div class="tearout-container">
			<div class="tearout indianred" draggable="false"></div>
		</div>

		<h2>Drag Out &amp; Back In</h2>
		<p>
			This tearout will remain frameless and can be dragged back into 
			its container
		</p> 
		<div class="tearout-container">
			<div class="tearout gold" draggable="false">
				Some 
				<input type="text">
				Inputs  
				<input type="text">
			</div>
		</div>

		<h2>Keep In Mind</h2>
		<p>
			Applications such as MarketStack <span class="browser-link" destination="http://openfin.co/app-gallery.html">(
			available on OpenFin’s Gallery)</span>  create a tearout experience without actually moving DOM from one one 
			window to another. Before transferring DOM elements from one window to another, decide if this is the best 
			experience for the user.
